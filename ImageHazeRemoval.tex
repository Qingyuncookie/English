\title{image haze removal}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\par Recently, I read some papers about image haze removal. And 2009 cvpr best paper writed by Kaiming He make me impressed. First,they proposed a novel prior-dark channel prior-for the single haze removal. It's based on the statistics of outdoor haze-free images. Second, they combine a haze imaging model and estimate two parameters according to the dark channel prior. And finally a high -quality haze-free image is recovered.
\par Certainly, there are many excellent methods appearing from 2009 to now, some people improve this method,and some innovate new. Especially recent years, haze, fog and smoke are such phenomena that have had a serious impact on our lives. So, we should make great efforts to help solve these problems. Even if not everyone have the ability to research the methods about the image dehazing, all of us can try our best to protect environment.
