\title{Lolita}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\par Today, I want to talk about a story, which is beautiful and sorrowful. The author is Vladimir Nabokov, he is Russian, however he wrote this story in English. And it is also fluent and touching. At the beginning, he said:" Lolita,light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul." This sentence hited my heart when I first read it. It was so moving that I forgot it's what a middle-aged men said to a underage girl, moreover he was her stepfather.
\par However, though the story is a little wired, it's indubitable that the love is true whatever others say. There is also a poem in the end.Now I am writting it here, and I want to tell you, fearless is having fears but jumping anyway.
\par My car is limping, Dolores.Haze
\par And the last long lap is the hardest
\par And I shall be dumped where the weed decays
\par And the rest is rust and slardust
